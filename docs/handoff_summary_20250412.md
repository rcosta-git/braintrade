# BrainTrade - Handoff Summary (2025-04-12 ~10:12 PM ET)

## Project Goal

Implement Phase 1 of the BrainTrade stress monitor (`stress_monitor.py`) as outlined in `README.md` and `docs/phase1_stress_meter_plan.md`. This involves real-time monitoring of EEG Alpha/Beta ratio and PPG-derived heart rate relative to a baseline to determine a stress state (Calm, Warning, Stress).

## Work Completed

1.  **Planning & Review:** Reviewed project documentation (`README.md`, `phase1_stress_meter_plan.md`) and the existing `stress_monitor.py` code.
2.  **RuntimeWarning Fix:** Addressed an MNE `RuntimeWarning` related to filter length by adjusting the IIR filter order (`order=4`) and increasing the EEG analysis window (`EEG_WINDOW_DURATION = 3`).
3.  **Parameter Configuration:** Made key parameters (thresholds, window durations, filter settings, persistence) configurable via command-line arguments in `stress_monitor.py`.
4.  **State Logic Refactoring:** Moved the state determination and persistence logic from the main loop into a dedicated function `update_stress_state` for better modularity and testability.
5.  **Unit Testing:** Created `test_stress_monitor.py` with unit tests using synthetic data for:
    *   `estimate_bpm_from_ppg`
    *   `extract_alpha_beta_ratio` (including fixes for power calculation and near-zero denominator checks)
    *   `update_stress_state` (covering various transitions and edge cases)
    *   All unit tests are currently passing.
6.  **Error Handling & Logging:**
    *   Implemented basic logging using the `logging` module, directing output to console and `logs/stress_monitor.log`.
    *   Added timestamps to data buffers and a check in the main loop to detect and handle potentially stale data.
    *   Added basic error handling around the OSC server thread.
    *   Refined the baseline calculation logic to collect data first and then process it using sliding windows.

## Current Status & Issue

*   The `stress_monitor.py` script has been significantly updated based on the plan and debugging steps.
*   Unit tests for core components are passing.
*   OSC data reception is confirmed working via the separate `check_osc.py` script.
*   **Current Problem:** When running `python3 stress_monitor.py`, the script starts the OSC server but hangs during the baseline calculation phase (specifically during `time.sleep()` within the data collection loop) and does not produce the expected log output (like "Calculating baseline...", "Baseline sample...", or real-time monitoring updates) to the console or the log file. It requires manual interruption (Ctrl+C). This occurs even though `check_osc.py` confirms data is arriving at the correct port.

## Next Steps (Debugging)

The immediate next step is to diagnose why `stress_monitor.py` hangs during baseline calculation without producing log output. Potential actions:

1.  **Add Early Print Statements:** Insert basic `print()` statements at the very beginning of `main()` and `calculate_baseline()` in `stress_monitor.py` (before logging is configured) to confirm execution reaches these points.
2.  **Simplify Baseline Loop:** Temporarily remove the `time.sleep()` within the baseline data collection loop to see if the loop itself completes or if the hang occurs elsewhere.
3.  **Check Threading/Locking:** Review the use of `threading.Lock` (`data_lock`) to ensure there isn't a deadlock situation preventing the main thread from proceeding or the OSC thread from writing data.
4.  **Examine Resource Usage:** Monitor system resources while the script is running to check for excessive memory or CPU consumption during the baseline phase.

The goal is to get the script to successfully complete the baseline calculation and enter the real-time monitoring loop, logging output as expected.

Welcome to BrainFlowâ€™s documentation!

BrainFlow is a library intended to obtain, parse and analyze EEG, EMG, ECG and other kinds of data from biosensors.

It provides a uniform data acquisition API for all supported boards, it means that you can switch boards without any changes in code and applications on top of BrainFlow are board agnostic. Also there is powerful API to perform signal processing which you can use even without BCI headset. Both of these two APIs are the same across bindings.

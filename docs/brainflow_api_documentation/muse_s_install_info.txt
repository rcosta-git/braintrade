On Linux systems you may need to install libdbus and we recommend to compile BrainFlow from the source code:

sudo apt-get install libdbus-1-dev # for ubuntu
sudo yum install dbus-devel # for centos
python3 tools/build.py --ble # to compile

To create such board you need to specify the following board ID and fields of BrainFlowInputParams object:

    BoardIds.MUSE_S_BOARD

    optional: mac_address, mac address of the device to connect

    optional: serial_number, device name, can be printed on the Muse device or discoovered via mobile apps

Initialization Example:

params = BrainFlowInputParams()
board = BoardShim(BoardIds.MUSE_S_BOARD, params)

Supported platforms:

    Windows 10.0.19041.0+

    MacOS 10.15+, 12.0 to 12.2 have known issues while scanning, you need to update to 12.3+. On MacOS 12+ you may need to configure Bluetooth permissions for your appication

    Linux, compilation from source code probably will be needed

    Devices like Raspberry Pi

Available BrainFlow Presets:

    BrainFlowPresets.DEFAULT_PRESET, it contains EEG data, to enable 5th EEG channel use board.config_board("p50")

    BrainFlowPresets.AUXILIARY_PRESET, it contains Gyro and Accel data, enabled by default

    BrainFlowPresets.ANCILLARY_PRESET, it contains PPG data, to enable it use board.config_board("p61")
